    <p>Favorite Culture that I am not native to is Hawaii. Hawaii is home to the world's 
       most active volcano, Kilauea. The islands are also home to the 
       largest above-ground volcano in the world, 
       Mauna Loa, which towers at nearly 14,000 feet high.</p>
    <p>Mother Teresa, her dedication to helping the poorest and sickest communities. 
        Mahatma Ghandi, as he inspires with his resistence.

    <p>A meal that represents me is Falafel.</p>
    <p>I feel most creative when I am surrounded my nature. </p>
